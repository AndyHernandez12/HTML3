			<header><p><h1> Top 3 Anime Shows that inspired Andy Hernandez.</h1></p>
			<p>List not in any order</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Naruto: Shippudden</li>
				<li>One Punch Man </li>
				<li>Bleach </li>
			</ul>
			<p id="Creative Process">Drawing and storytelling have been inspired by many shows and movies such as Batman V Superman, Interstellar, Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan and more. But just like in bed, it takes time for things to happen naturally, you can't just jump in without any role play, so here are 3 things that help Andy get comfortable before dominating.</p>
			
				
			<ol>
				<li>Drink a glass of water and deep breathing exercises immediately after waking up.</li>
				<li>Drink a giant cup of coffee.</li>
				<li>Eat three over-easy eggs, avocados, with toast.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<dl>
  				<dt>Drinking water and Breathing exercises</dt>
  				<dd>-When you drink water immediately after waking up, it helps in preventing kidney stones and bladder infections and helps you feel more energized.</dd>
  				
				<dt>Giant cup of coffe</dt>
  				<dd>-Andy loves coffee in the morning. From the smell, taste and excitement it all comes together to make for a relaxing morning.</dd>
				
				<dt>Breakfast</dt>
				<dd>- Andy can usually eat a full course meal for breakfast, but his favorite healthy breakfast meal consists of 3 or more eggs, sunny side up or scrambled, with a freshly cut avocado and toast with butter.</dd>
